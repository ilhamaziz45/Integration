Integral is a concept of continuous addition in mathematics, and is the opposite of a differential or an ordinary derivative also called an antiderivative. There is an indefinite integral and a definite integral

An indefinite integral is an integral with no upper and lower bounds, while a definite integral is an integral with an upper and lower limit.

A method is needed to calculate the area under the graph and is limited by the upper and lower limits. Some of the methods that are often used are Midpoint and Trapezoidal.

Both can be used to calculate the area under the graph, but python takes a long time to give a large value of N. Because both are conventional methods with looping methods. The larger the value of N given, the longer the computer takes to loop.

Therefore, a more effective method for calculating integrals is written, namely the array method. Where the values ​​are sorted from smallest to largest value without looping. This method is called Vectorized
